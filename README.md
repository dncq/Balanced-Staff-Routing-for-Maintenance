# BALANCED-STAFF-ROUTING-FOR-MAINTENANCE

# Problem description

There exist N customers where customer i resides in city i (i= 1,2,3,...,N) that demand Internet maintenance service. The maintenance service of customer i last for d[i] (time unit). There are K employees departing from one single depot (denoted by 0). The traveling time between two location i and j (i,j = 0,1,...,N) is t[i,j]. The objective is to schedule a plan in which the maximum working time (equals to the traveling time plus the maintenance time) among the employees is minimized.
